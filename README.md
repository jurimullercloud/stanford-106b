# Stanford 106b Assignment solutions
This repository contains solutions to the HW assignments for the 2018 Winter classes. For more details see https://web.stanford.edu/class/archive/cs/cs106b/cs106b.1184/homework.shtml.  
 

## Disclaimer
The repository references Stanford Cpp Library (for the current active repository, see https://github.com/zelenski/stanford-cpp-library). Although library developers advise usage of QtCreator as the main Ide to utilise the library, I found this link https://iitd-plos.github.io/col100/labs/without-qt.html that has zip file containing necessary files. I then slightly modified `CmakeLists.txt` and `build.sh` files to make it more easy to build and install in my Linux machine.
